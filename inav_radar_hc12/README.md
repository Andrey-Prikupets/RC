# LoRa based inter UAV communication

INAV-Radar is an addition to the [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) flight control software, it relays information about UAVs in the area to the flight controller for display on the OSD. INAV-Radar does this by using [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) radio to broadcast position, altitude, speed and plane name. It also listens for other UAVs so INAV OSD  can display this information as a HUD.

*** 1.30 (2019/05/18)

    Radar logo at boot
    Better timings, greatly reduced display latency
    Many cosmetic tweaks and fixes
    Newest inav 2.2.dev REQUIRED (built 2019/05/18 or newer)


*** 1.20 (2019/05/14)

    Better timing for MSP and air packets
    5 nodes capable, but locked at 4 nodes for now
    Faster rate for MSP messages to improve tracking accuracy
    in iNav 2.2, faster display to reduce tracking stuttering
    Known issue : sometime the debug page with the timings
    reboots the module


*** 1.01 (2019/05/06)

    - More detailled screens per nodes
    - Displays the local vbat and mAh. These datas are not yet
      transmitted to the other nodes.
    - Pressing the top button during the boot sequence will put
      the module in "silent" mode (ground-station), it will only
      receive, and won't transmit, thus freeing a slot. Button
      must be pressed at least once, between the time the module
      is plugged and the end of the SCAN progress bar.
    - No need to update iNav since 1.00, no changes.

*** 1.00 (2019/04/25)

    - Initial release
    - Require iNav 2.2-dev, including the latest version for the
      Hud branch (build date 2019/04/27 or newer)
    - Cycle time 500ms, slotspacing 125ms, LoRA SF9 bw250,
      maximum 4 nodes (you + 3 others)

## Hardware

Current development is done using these cheap ESP32 LoRa modules.

There are different variants for 433MHz and 868/915MHz:

[Banggood: ESP32 Lora 868/915MHz (2 Pcs)](https://www.banggood.com/de/2Pcs-Wemos-TTGO-LORA32-868915Mhz-ESP32-LoRa-OLED-0_96-Inch-Blue-Display-p-1239769.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

[Banggood: ESP32 Lora 433MHz](https://www.banggood.com/de/Wemos-TTGO-LORA-SX1278-ESP32-0_96OLED-16-Mt-Bytes-128-Mt-bit-433Mhz-For-Arduino-p-1205930.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

Other variants (e.g. Heltec) or without OLED display and different antenna connectors should also work.

Also please keep track of your countries regulations regarding radio transmissions.

## Development

Everything here is WORK IN PROGRESS!

The software is based on two components:
- ESP32 LoRa part is found in this repo.
It's developed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor.
- INAV OSD part repo is found [here](https://github.com/OlivierC-FR/inav/tree/oc_hud).
It's a fork from the INAV repo and instructions how to build can be found [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/development/Building%20in%20Docker.md).

INAV-Radar is a experimental firmware based on INAV and soon will become a part of the INAV flight control software. INAV repo can be found [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav).

## ESP32 firmware flashing

With the installer (Only Windows at the moment, for Linux / Mac os user see "Manual flashing" (bottom of page) 

For testing there is no need to install Atom and PlatformIO, just use the [ESP32 firmware installer](https://github.com/KingKone/INAV-Radar_Installer/releases) for flashing.

## Wireing

To connect the ESP32 to the FC:
- wire up +5V and GND
- TX from FC to ESP RX pin 17
- RX from FC to ESP TX pin 23


## FC settings

Backup your FC settings, flash the current [testing version of INAV](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/releases).

Dump your backup back into the cli.

Activate MSP on the corresponding UART, the speed is 115200.
Enable the crosshair.

Please also flash the extra Vision OSD fonts for signal strenth and the homing crosshair. Vision 1 is small/light, Vision 4 is heavy/bold.

The HUD has an entry in the stick menu (OSD->HUD) where you can change this configuration at runtime.

Optional OSD and HUD cli settings:
```
osd_layout 0 2 0 0 V       
osd_layout 0 43 0 0 H      
osd_layout 0 44 0 0 H      
osd_layout 0 45 0 0 H 
set osd_crosshairs_style = TYPE6
set osd_horizon_offset = 0
set osd_camera_uptilt = 0
set osd_camera_fov_h = 135
set osd_camera_fov_v = 85
set osd_hud_margin_h = 1
set osd_hud_margin_v = 3
set osd_hud_homing = ON
set osd_hud_homepoint = ON
set osd_hud_radar_disp = 4
set osd_hud_radar_range_min = 1
set osd_hud_radar_range_max = 4000
```

## Manual Flashing ESP method:

Your system may needs the driver for the USB UART bridge:
[Windows+MacOS](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
 or [Alternative MacOS](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver)

You will need [Python 3.4 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

Be sure to check 'Add Python to PATH':

The latest stable esptool.py release can be installed via pip in your command prompt:

Windows:
```
c:\> pip install esptool
```

MacOS:
```
$ pip3 install esptool
```

Download the air-to-air test firmware from the [releases page](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/releases)
and extract it. Run this command to flash it onto your ESP32 Lora module (Windows and MacOS):

You may change the --port to match your operating system. If you are using Windows check the [device manager](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/raw/master/docs/devManager.PNG).

Windows:
```
c:\> cd (your air-to-air directory here)
c:\> esptool.py --port COM11 write_flash -z --flash_mode dio 0x1000 bootloader_dio_40m.bin 0x8000 default.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

MacOS:
```
$ cd (your air-to-air directory here)
$ esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -z --flash_mode dio 0x1000 bootloader_dio_40m.bin 0x8000 default.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin

```

The output should look something like this:
